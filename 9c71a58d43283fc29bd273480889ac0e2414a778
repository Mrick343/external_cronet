      "message": "I think it\u0027s still worthwhile to keep them separate to better represent their dependencies. I think this should also speed up compilation times, as changing ExperimentalOptions.java will only require recompiling cronet_experimental_options, while other jars can be reused.\n\nP.S. In a child CL (https://android-review.git.corp.google.com/c/platform/external/cronet/+/2647867/9) I end up merging them into a final http_client_logging library.",
