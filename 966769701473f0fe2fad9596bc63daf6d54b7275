That\u0027s very bad for battery life (the modem will never go to sleep) so perhaps we should mention here that this is only for short-lived requests where responsiveness is important?",

      "message": "IIRC the stack had some timers to force return to the default network even if migration succeeded, and also had some data limits for non-default network usage. Do those still exist? If so it might be worth mentioning here that they do.\n\nActually I see setMaxTimeOnNonDefaultNetworkSeconds below, and that we\u0027re not planning to expose  presumably since nobody uses it. Maybe, though, we could set that to a reasonable value (30 seconds?) and mention that here?\n\nWas there a data usage limit too? Or do I misremember? I guess for the data limit we should probably use getMultipathPreference.\n\nAlso, spurious trailing space.",
