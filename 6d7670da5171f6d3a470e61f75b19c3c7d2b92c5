I think that somehow we are not referencing components/cronet/android/test/javatests/src/org/chromium/net/FileUtils.java in our Android.bp?\n\nThere is a FileUtils class in net just for Cronet\u0027s sake. The one in base has been updated to make use of java.util.function.Function (which is unavailable on Android \u003c\u003d M). See https://crrev.com/c/4055100 and https://crbug.com/1393109.\n\nIdeall, we should be using that (which lives in the org.chromium.net package, hence the missing import) to maintain upstream-downstream consistency (this can be forward fixed).",
