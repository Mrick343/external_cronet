      "message": "Unfortunately there are a lot of CLs in between https://crrev.com/c/4667153 and what is currently in AOSP.\n\nI\u0027ve decided to temporarily fork CronetTestRule into CronetTestRuleNew (which is a copy of upstream\u0027s CronetTestRule) to avoid having to cherry-pick every single CL.\n\nDoing this allows to only update CronetManifestTest.java (which is the only test file that has been touched by the CL I\u0027m trying to cherry-pick) to its upstream state, and allows to leave every other test file untouched.",
