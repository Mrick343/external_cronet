I couldn\u0027t figure out how to reasonably split it up into smaller changes.\n\nFWIW, there is still some cleanup we can do in Android.extras.bp after this change has merged. (And I really want to find a solution to let the script handle the translation of these rules -- especially if we have to live with these imported tests for a longer period of time.)",
