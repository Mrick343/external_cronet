      "message": "using `test_suites` for the helper apps installs the helper apps in those suites and when you use `required` for a module, those required helper apps will be installed wherever this module is installed.\n\nWe prefer declaring this kind of dependency in the `data` field. when `data` field is used to declare dependencies, they are copied to the same folder as the test. This allow Tradefed to isolate test modules and enable features like partial download(we will only download dependencies that a test needs instead of everything that was included in the suites zip file).\n\nWhen you declare dependencies with `data` field, you don\u0027t need to separately use `test_suites` for the helper apps.

I am not sure i understand the coverage thing, but what i see from build system standpoint is that your test doesn\u0027t declare that dependency and use it, which is straight up wrong and will be prevented soon.\n@joeo@google.com for input on what we are missing .\n\nDeclaring a dependency in data is the usual way of doing this.
