Even though referenced classes don\u0027t exist in the source tree (though they will be restored eventually), gn gen / desc should still succeed. As long as none of the affected targets are a dependency of the mainline build (which they shouldn\u0027t be, otherwise that needs to be fixed), deleting this patch and some of the follow-ups should be fine.",
