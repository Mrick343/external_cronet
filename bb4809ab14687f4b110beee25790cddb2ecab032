This looks great and it looks like you figured out a lot of those things on your own.\n\nThis is actually a [very common way](https://source.corp.google.com/aosp-master/cts/hostsidetests) we run tests in Android (by installing a test .apk and controlling the test from the host). Can this be integrated into the [existing framework for Connectivity hostside tests](https://source.corp.google.com/aosp-master/packages/modules/Connectivity/tests/cts/hostside)? Note that it *may* make sense to duplicate a similar setup in and place it in packages/modules/Connectivity/Cronet/tests/cts/hostside rather than touching HostsideNetworkTestCase (that\u0027s something to look into).",
